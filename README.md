# Employee-Performance-Analysis

 Project Summary

### Requirement
   INX Future Inc, is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with over 15 years of global business presence. In recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this has become a growing concern among the top management. The CEO Mr. Brain, decided to initiate a data science project, which analyzes the current employee data and find the core underlying causes of the performance issues. He also expects a clear indicators of non-performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employee, if required, may not significantly affect other employee morals.             
   The following insights are expected from this project:
- Department wise performances.
- Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance.
- A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs.
- Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.

### Summary
   The project was done with the purpose of finding out factors which affected the Performance of the employees, training a model which accurately predicts the Performance Rating of the employee, analyzing the data to provide recommendations to improve the performance and gain insights from the analysis.
   The following steps were carried out:
1. Import the data provided, find out the predictor & target variables and look for missing values.
2. Analysis of Department wise performance as asked.
3. Label Encoding the ordinal columns.
4. Calculate correlation coeffecient to find out the relationship between variables and then select the important features for analysis.
5. Standardizing the data and splitting it into test and train.
6. Training the data using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost Classifier and checking the accuracy to find out which algorithm is the best.
7. Exporting the model with highest accuracy.
